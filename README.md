# Coding Kata Workshop

Kata is a Japanese word, meaning a detailed choreographed pattern of movements made to be practiced alone or within groups when training.

> Kata is a also term used by software engineers in the Software Craftsmanship movement. 
> Software Engineers who call themselves Software Craftsmen, will write Kata.
> Software Kata is a small snippet of code written in one sitting, repeatedly, often daily, in order to build up muscle memory and practice their craft.

Code Kata is a way to bring these element of practice to software development.

1) Repeat a task many times and make litte improvement in each time.
2) Build up muscle memory on specifc tasks. Remember stuff you learned along the way.
3) Short exercise (30 - 45 min long)
4) Programming to solve similar problems in different ways. 
5) The goal of coding kata is not getting to the final solutions. The goal is to practice regulary. 


A good coding kata practice sesison would be as follows:

1) A time without interruptions
2) A simple thing you want to try as many times as it takes
3) Review any mistakes that you made and learn from it
4) Look for feedback each time and work to improve
5) No pressure and no deadline

In this workshop, we will work together to go through one software kata exercise. 
We will go over some of the techniques to focus and pratice your kata, and solve problems differently.


# Programming Kata

The Bowling Game Kata.

The bowling game consists of 10 frames.  
In each frame the player has two opportunities to knock down 10 pins.  
The score for the frame is the total number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for strikes and spares.

A spare is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two tries.  
The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll.  

A strike is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first try.  The bonus
for that frame is the value of the next two balls rolled.

In the tenth frame a player who rolls a spare or strike is allowed to roll the extra
balls to complete the frame.  However no more than three balls can be rolled in
tenth frame.

# Git Kata

You will be working in your own branch. This time we will be working with branches in git.

1) Create a branch called greeting and check it out
2) Edit the greeting.txt to contain your favorite greeting
3) Add greeting.txt files to the staging area
4) Commit
5) Switch back to the master branch
6) Create a file README.md with information about this repository
7) Add the README.md file to staging area and make the commit
8) What is the output of git log --oneline --graph --all?
9) Diff the branches
10) Merge the greeting branch into master


# Linux Kata

1) Create two users, Ravi and Kumar
2) Make them members of the second group SystemAdministrators
3) Ravi should have interactive login shell
4 )Kumar should have no login shell
5) Create an collaborative directory path /dir/data
6) The directory should be owned by SystemAdministrators
7) All files created under this directory should have group permissions
8) Others should not have any access to this directory
